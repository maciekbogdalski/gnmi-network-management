#### The goal of the project is to develop a micro-service that utilizes a GNMI library written in Java/Groovy. This service should function as a GNMI client towards external servers and have the ability to implement an Open-API interface. The micro-service should also allow subscription to export GNMI streams using various modes, such as Stream, Poll, and Once. Additionally, the service should enable the import of yang models to define the structure of GNMI primitive content.
