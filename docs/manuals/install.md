# Installation Guide

After compiling the GNMI Microservice, follow these steps to install and set up the application on your system.

## Prerequisites

- Compiled JAR file from the build process
- Docker (if running dependent services in containers)

## Installation Steps

1. Ensure that the compiled JAR file is located in the `build/libs` directory.

2. If your system requires any environment setup or configuration files, ensure they are placed in the appropriate directories as per the project structure.

3. For running any dependent services like gNMI target servers, refer to the Docker setup instructions provided in the main `README.md`.

No further installation steps are required, as the JAR file is executable and contains all necessary dependencies.
